# Project Overview

StreamList is a completed React-based Progressive Web Application (PWA) developed as the final project for the INT499 Information Technology Capstone course at the University of Arizona Global Campus.

The application provides users with a centralized platform to:

* Manage a personal streaming watchlist
* Search live movie information using The Movie Database (TMDB) API
* Manage streaming subscriptions and entertainment accessories
* Store data using Local Storage
* Install the application as a desktop Progressive Web App (PWA)

Throughout the five-week capstone project, StreamList evolved from a basic React application into a fully functional Progressive Web Application demonstrating modern frontend development practices, responsive design, REST API integration, AI-assisted testing, and Progressive Web App technologies.
